# OcSt Switcher

Switch from Oculus to Steam VR and from Steam VR to oculus easily on rift/quest and quest 2.

This project uses the excellent little project [Oculus Killer](https://github.com/ItsKaitlyn03/OculusKiller) to disable oculus dash and make it go directly through the steam VR interface, it allows to save RAM, CPU and GPU, for small pc this is a very good solution.
